# Protein ATIP3, encoded by the *MTUS1* gene

ATIP3 is a tumor suppressor protein encoded by the *MTUS1* gene and is involved in microtubule stabilization and mitotic regulation. Several isoforms of MTUS1 exist (ATIP1â€“4), generated by alternative splicing, each with distinct expression profiles and potential functions.

ATIP3, in particular, is frequently downregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where its loss has been associated with increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

The notebook `./tests/MTUS1_Transcripts.ipynb` analyzes the transcript-level expression of MTUS1 isoforms (ATIP family) across CCLE cancer cell lines, using RNA-seq data, with a focus on isoform-specific patterns across different TCGA cancer types (**Appendix B** of my thesis).

The notebook `./tests/Depmap_sensitivity_v1.ipynb` assembles the analyses used to produce **Tables B.2 and B.3** in **Appendix B** (referenced in **Chapter 5** of my thesis). It screens drugs whose efficacy varies with the expression level of a gene of interest (e.g., *MTUS1* / ATIP3) across cancer cell lines, using  **PRISM** and **GDSC2** panels.
