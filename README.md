# Protein ATIP3, encoded by the *MTUS1* gene

ATIP3 is a tumor suppressor protein encoded by the *MTUS1* gene and is involved in microtubule stabilization and mitotic regulation. Several isoforms of MTUS1 exist (ATIP1â€“4), generated by alternative splicing, each with distinct expression profiles and potential functions.

ATIP3, in particular, is frequently downregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where its loss has been associated with increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

The notebook `./tests/MTUS1_Transcripts.ipynb` analyzes the transcript-level expression of MTUS1 isoforms (ATIP family) across CCLE cancer cell lines, using RNA-seq data, with a focus on isoform-specific patterns across different TCGA cancer types.
